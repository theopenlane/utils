# Test data

The .zip file in this directory is specific for testing adding a zip file as an attachment to an email. This directory is also used as the output for MIME generation so if you leverage the "eyeball" flag, it will write MIME files into the `eyeballTestEmailBuilders` directory which should not be committed back to git (and is excluded).
