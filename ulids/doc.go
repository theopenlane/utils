// Package ulids is a lightweight wrapper around the github.com/oklog/ulid package that provides some common functionality (like checking if a ULID is null or is zero)
// as well as a process-global, cryptographically random, monotonic, and thread-safe ulid generation mechanism that can be used from external packages
package ulids
